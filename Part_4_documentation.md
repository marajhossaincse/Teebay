Task 1: UI implementation
Implementing the UIs was a comparatively basic task that did not need much problem solving, and since a wireframe was already provided it made it even more easier. Nevertheless, the UI has much scope of improvement with spacings and centering of the components and may be making a little more polished.

Task 2: Biometric implementation
It is to be noted that in the simulator biometric is not supported, the only way of seeking the biometric in action is through a physical device that supports both finger print and face recognition. Unfortunately the device that I had at my disposal only supports finger print and not face recognition so I could only test it with that. Regardless, the biometric implementation was a pretty simple task since Apple wraps both of touch ID and face ID under the LocalAuthentication library.
